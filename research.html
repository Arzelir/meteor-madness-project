					For this project, we wanted to use APIs and databases provided by NASA to create a helpful service.
					Our project is a meteor impact simulator that demonstrates how much of an area can be affected by a
					meteor based on its mass and velocity. The simulator can demonstrate the inundation caused by the impact,
					the range of overpressure and the range of an earthquake. This simulator can benefit decision makers by
					creating an understanding of how much area will be affected by a meteor strike. There are preset asteroids
					that the user can choose from and a constantly updating list of asteroids that are currently near Earth.
					Users can visualize the different impact scenarios of the selectable or custom asteroids created.
				</p>
				<p>
					To calculate the asteroid impact, we used the mass and velocity to find the kinetic energy. We converted to the TNT equivalent and then used the cube-root scaling law (Hopkinson-Cranz scaling) with a preset overpressure (1 psi) to calculate the radius.
				</p>
				<p>
					The earthquake was calculated by using the Gutenberg-Richter energy-magnitude relation. The kinetic energy is calculated, and then a preset seismic coefficient is used to help calculate the force and range of the earthquake.
				</p>
				<p>
					The tsunami inundation was calculated by estimating the amount of energy that goes into the water, using a constant area impacted by the wave, and an average coastal slope of 0.01. Using this information, we were able to find an estimated range.
				</p>
				<p>
					This resource should be useful in learning more about meteor impacts and should help users prepare ahead for
					emergency situations. We hope to help the general public with this website, since many resources regarding these
					topics are too complex for most people.
